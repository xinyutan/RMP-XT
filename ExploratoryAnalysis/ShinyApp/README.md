This app is to display the wordclouds for the words that contribute to the best ratings as well as the ones that contributes to the worst ratings for different departments. We employed lasso regression to train the data for each department, and mapped the coefficients to the integer within 100 to 20, and then plot the wordcloud. The motivation for this plot is to roughly show the different words used by different departments, as our training may shape the way we describe things.
