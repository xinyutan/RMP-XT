This report is to explore the RMP dataset and to try to build up our understanding of the dataset. 

## Basic information of the dataset

```{r}
train <- read.csv('../../Data/train.csv', header = T, na.strings = c('N/A','[]'))
str(train)
```

```{r}
test <- read.csv('../../Data/test.csv', header = T, na.strings = c('N/A', '[]'))
str(test)
```

## Get a understanding of NA values

I noticed that besides comments, it seems that `train$tags` also indicates strongly whether that student has a positive comments or not. I am not sure if there are much overlaps between each `tags` or there are just too much NA values, so this part is to count the NA values in each columns.

```{r}
sapply(train, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))/nrow(train)
```

```{r}
sapply(test, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))/nrow(test)
```
